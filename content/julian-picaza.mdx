<summary><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></summary>

Julian was born in Miami, Florida, and raised in a multicultural household where the furniture of everyday life—language, symbol, sound—rarely stayed in one place. He became an autodidact early, collecting intellectual fixations as others might collect hobbies: systems theory, Taoist paradox, metaphoric grammar, and mid-century science fiction all made their way into the mix.

He studied [contemporary fine arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_art), [film production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking), and later [industrial design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_design) and [digital fabrication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_fabrication), building a deeply interdisciplinary foundation. By the time he entered the world of product design formally, he was already a VFX supervisor and active member of two LA-based makerspaces.

Still, his real education came through working—running fabrication shops, coordinating VFX pipelines, managing projects in rapidly shifting teams. He describes his learning style as **"Muck About and Find Out."**

<summary><strong>Core Present-Day Work</strong></summary>

**Creative Technology Consulting**  
Julian helps individuals and organizations prototype the future they're trying to describe. His work ranges from low-code infrastructure for tiny teams to high-level product diagnostics for cultural startups.

**Systems Design & Integration**  
Whether designing service architectures, managing data flows, or untangling team silos, Julian is drawn to the connective tissue between parts.

**Software Product Management**  
He's led platform development projects, particularly in hardware-adjacent spaces like fabrication software, aligning team workflows with strategic deliverables.

**Automation & Workflow Design**  
An early adopter of tools like [Zapier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapier), [n8n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N8n), and LLM-integrated agents, Julian builds systems that are modular, efficient, and often surprisingly humane.

**Prototyping & Hybrid Making**  
With a background in art and fabrication, Julian enjoys blending physical and digital materials—laser-cut installations, generative interfaces, experimental tooling.

<summary><strong>Historical Domains & Contextual Depth</strong></summary>

Julian's current capabilities are built on a rich foundation of earlier experiences.

He spent years working in [visual effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_effects) and [film production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_industry), both on set and in post, before founding and managing [makerspaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makerspace).

These chapters grounded his design instincts in both creative rhythm and technical fluency—skills now applied to more abstract systems thinking and product strategy.

<details>
<summary><strong>Under the Surface: Explorations & Ongoing Curiosities</strong></summary>

Julian maintains a quietly sprawling archive of conversations, speculative frameworks, and language tools—from GPT-assisted system maps to poetic glossaries.

His artistic practice continues behind the scenes, subtly shaping the way he frames technical work. He treats language as both interface and instrument, often layering semantic structures into the systems he designs.

Themes include [semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics), [knowledge graph design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph), and the evolving dialogue between [metamodernism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamodernism) and real-world tooling.
